# CIFAR-10 Convolutional Neural Network Classifier

**Language used:** Python (verion=3.6)

**Deep Learning framework used:** Tensorflow (verion=1.4.0)

This project is a CNN based image classifier. The architecture for the Deep Learning model is a slightly modified AlexNet (see AlexNet.png (image taken from Andrew Ng's deeplearning.ai specialization)). Please see AlexNet Variation for CIFAR-10.png for modifications.

The code is structured across multiple .py files:
* model.py holds the actual script for training and testing the model.
* Other .py files hold the dependencies for running model.py
